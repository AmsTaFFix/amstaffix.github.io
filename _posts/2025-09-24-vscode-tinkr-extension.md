And once again, I have made an extension for VSCode, which help you to make plugins and other stuff with 
[Tinkr](https://tinkr.site/). I have to say, that it is not 100% accurate, because I have not an opportunity to check 
the API in game, but [documentation](https://docs.tinkr.site/Lua/) is great. That's why I am encouraging you to participate 
in contributing into this project. You can do this by 
- [create an issue](https://github.com/WoW-U/vscode-tinkr-api/issues/new) 
- fix yourself and [create a pull request](https://github.com/WoW-U/vscode-tinkr-api/compare)
- join [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EuUvfKwVze) and write a message in 
  [tinkr-lua-api channel](https://discord.gg/4mETWj9Wmb) and I will help you

You can install an [extension from official VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmsTaFFix.tinkr-lua-api). 
Also, you can see the [source code](https://github.com/WoW-U/vscode-tinkr-api) of it.

If you have any ideas, please [contact me](https://github.com/AmsTaFFix#how-to-reach-me), or post a message in 
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/EuUvfKwVze) in [tinkr-lua-api channel](https://discord.gg/4mETWj9Wmb).
