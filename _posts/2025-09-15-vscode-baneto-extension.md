And once again, I have made an extension for VSCode, which help you to make plugins and other stuff with 
[Baneto Bot](https://baneto-bot.com/). I have to say, that it is not 100% complete, because 
[documentation](https://baneto-bot.com/api-doc) is not clear sometimes. That's why I am encouraging you to participate 
in contributing into this project. You can do this by 
- [create an issue](https://github.com/WoW-U/vscode-baneto-api/issues/new) 
- fix yourself and [create a pull request](https://github.com/WoW-U/vscode-baneto-api/compare)
- join [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EuUvfKwVze) and write a message in 
  [baneto-lua-api channel](https://discord.com/channels/1416682119454916691/1416682708779929600) and I will help you

You can install an [extension from official VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmsTaFFix.baneto-lua-api). 
Also, you can see the [source code](https://github.com/WoW-U/vscode-baneto-api) of it.

If you have any ideas, please [contact me](https://github.com/AmsTaFFix#how-to-reach-me), or post a message in 
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/EuUvfKwVze) in [baneto-lua-api channel](https://discord.com/channels/1416682119454916691/1416682708779929600).
