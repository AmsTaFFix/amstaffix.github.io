# The problem

Hi to all, today I want to discuss. As you know, there are no ways to share private repo via a link, and as I know, there 
are no plans to do it.  

There are some discussions on that theme:
- [https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/44506](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/44506)
- [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31264165/can-i-share-my-private-github-repository-by-link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31264165/can-i-share-my-private-github-repository-by-link)

I did not find any information on how to do it inside GitHub itself, but there are some workarounds with apps. 

# Solutions

## GitHub Gist

Of course, you can use [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), create a new gist, mark it as private, and share the link. 
It may work in some cases, but in not mine.

## [gitshare.me](https://gitshare.me/)

This is a very nice-looking app, looks professional, and it works. But I still cannot get content of the repos :)

It gives you the possibility to share only one private repo, after it, you have to pay. ![img_1.png](/images/2025-10-09-share-private-github-repo-via-link-img-2.png)

## [gitshare.onrender.com](https://gitshare.onrender.com/) by [Abhishek Rajput](https://github.com/Abhishek-2502)

It has all functions that I need for free. Generate a link, show the repository's content, have a feature to download 
files. Also, it has a preview feature.

Of course, it has some bugs and flaws, but it works. I already have made a link for my private repo, and it works well.

Here is an example: [fallout-76-mods](https://gitshare.onrender.com/share/e73fe32657707beba2635364b1c2f1c19382a6fee941ddea37f1a0b2695fc0ce)
