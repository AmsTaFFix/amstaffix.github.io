I'm excited to share my latest project: a VSCode extension specifically designed for developers working with the 
GMR (presumably a World of Warcraft addon framework) Lua API. This extension aims to streamline the development 
process and make coding WoW addons more efficient and enjoyable.

## What is GMR?

You know if you know :)

## Why Create This Extension?

Developing addons for World of Warcraft using Lua can be a complex task, especially when working with specialized 
APIs like GMR. The main challenges developers face include:

- **Lack of IntelliSense**: Without proper autocomplete and function signatures, developers often have to reference 
    documentation constantly
- **No Syntax Highlighting**: Generic Lua syntax highlighting doesn't account for GMR-specific functions and constants
- **Documentation Access**: Quick access to API documentation while coding
- **Error Prevention**: Type checking and parameter validation to catch errors early

## Features of the Extension

My VSCode extension addresses these pain points by providing:

### Enhanced IntelliSense Support
- Autocomplete for GMR API functions
- Parameter hints and function signatures
- Context-aware suggestions based on GMR's API structure

### Integrated Documentation
- Hover tooltips with function descriptions
- Quick access to GMR API documentation

## Impact on Development Workflow

Since using this extension, GMR addon development has become significantly more efficient:

- **Reduced Documentation Lookup**: Developers spend less time switching between code and documentation
- **Faster Coding**: Autocomplete and snippets speed up the coding process
- **Fewer Bugs**: Early error detection prevents runtime issues

## Installation and Usage

The extension can be installed directly from the VSCode Marketplace. Once installed, it automatically activates 
when working with Lua files in GMR addon projects.

## Conclusion

The extension is available on the VSCode Marketplace, and I welcome feedback and contributions from the GMR addon 
development community. Whether you're a seasoned addon developer or just starting with GMR, 
this extension aims to make your development journey smoother and more productive.
