Hi to all, as I know not everybody registered at Github and it is not convenient to register there to create an issue :)
A lot of conversation and ticket support is done via Discord. That's why I created a Discord server where you can 
discuss all my works, ask questions and get support.

I know that I have already added a link to Discord in other posts, but I want to make it more visible.
